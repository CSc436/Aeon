NOTES & IDEAS

creativity / people making levels

land vs. crashing

land

pirate caves collect treasure, opens the door

collect gems or something, door (point that you reach when you're done with level)

secret bases, with traps inside, open doors with some collectable?

warp point, collectable

warping, start warp point, end warp point

approachable, creative, saturated?
"mockup screenshot" to experiment with this.

story, motivation: tile-based, rectangular shape
tapes? replacing the gems?

terrain
background
wooden crates
steel crates

clouds

landscape, horizon shot, repeating horizontally
terrain? dirt/rocks? steel/building-like?

color palette

///////////SUMMARY///////////////

landing on the planet to look for treasure
it's like a lost civilization, filled with traps and stuff
level starts with a warp point (maybe?)
level ends with a warp gate.

this sprint we want to get sprites in for:
terrain, background, steel, and wooden crate

TODO:
determine a better art style for the game, maybe experiment with a mockup screenshot
want brighter, more saturated colors, sharper outlines, maybe pixelated feel

came up with menu colors: dark/black background, white text, teal highlight color
TODO:
experiment with drawing of planet Aeon for main menu.
what if it was in the same art style as the in-game sprites?
