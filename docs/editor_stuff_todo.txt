There should be "selection" tool at top of tile list
	when using, should select a bounding box around whatever you're highlighting
	if you already have a selection, can modify the selection by holding shift and clicking
for other tools,
	when you click and drag, it should snake (no bounding box)
	when you hold shift, you get the bounding box
		you see a preview of your box until you decide to commit.
	you get a preview when mouse-over-ing over tiles
There should be "eraser" tool next to selection
	when click and drag, should snake (no bounding box, unless holding shft)

Design a new keyboard manager strictly for the editor to use
	instead of relying on KeyMan's callbacks
keys:
	Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, Ctrl+X		copy/paste/cut
	Arrow keys			scroll level
	Page Up/Down			scroll level
	Mouse Wheel			scroll level
	Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y			undo/redo
	Ctrl+=, Ctrl+-			zoom in/out
	Ctrl+MouseWheel			zoom in/out
	Ctrl+Enter			Test (Play Level)
	Delete/Backspace		clear the tile
