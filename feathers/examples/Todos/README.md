# Todos Example for Feathers

This [Feathers](http://feathersui.com/) example mocks up a simple application to track things that need to get done. It extends the MetalWorksMobileTheme and uses a custom list item renderer that can switch into an editing mode to delete items.

## Requirements

In addition to the Starling and Feathers libraries, this example project has the following requirements:

* `MetalWorksMobileTheme` is an example theme included with Feathers. You can find it in the _themes_ directory. You may link this theme to your project as an external library, or you can copy the theme's source files and assets into your project instead, if you prefer.
