# Gallery Example for Feathers

Displays a simple gallery of images from the [Flickr API](http://www.flickr.com/services/api/) using [Feathers](http://feathersui.com/). This example shows how to use a horizontal layout and a custom item renderer with a List component. Additionally, this example demonstrates how to [extend a theme](http://wiki.starling-framework.org/feathers/extending-themes) by adding a new style to the `MetalWorksMobileTheme` example theme.

## Requirements

In addition to the Starling and Feathers libraries, this example project has the following requirements:

* `MetalWorksMobileTheme` is an example theme included with Feathers. You can find it in the _themes_ directory. You may link this theme to your project as an external library, or you can copy the theme's source files and assets into your project instead, if you prefer.
